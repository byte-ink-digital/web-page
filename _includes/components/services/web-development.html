              today about 97% of those use JavaScript. JavaScript frameworks, therefore, play a key part of any modern enterprise-level
              frontend web development. In general they provide developers with reliable and tested tools for building scalable,
              interactive web solutions. After extensive experience with Angular and React, lately, our focus is also shifting to
              Flutter for web.

                  Angular is a Javascript framework built using Typescript and managed by Googleâ€™s Angular Team and the Angular
                  developer community. It is mostly used to build complex enterprise-grade apps like single-page applications
                  and progressive web applications. While having a steeper learning curve, as it is a full-fledged framework,
                  features like Two-way data binding, Directives, Dependency injection and a large community enable it to
                  reduce the time and ease the development effort.

                  Flutter is the right solution when building a web and mobile apps at the same time, and therefore utilizing a
                  single codebase for the entire project. However, developers still need to create responsive UIs, as the web and
                  mobile apps will work on various screen sizes and resolutions. Flutter also enables a fast development with
                  hot-reload which works by injecting updated source code files into the running Dart Virtual Machine
                  and enables instant visualisation of the implemented change.
