          Product design, at its core, is actually a problem solving activity. A process where one uses different tools
          and ideas to discover and define a product or a service that will improve a user experience or satisfy a
          specific business need. Weather designing a <b> System</b>, <b>Process</b> or an <b>Interface</b> it is all about discovering and
          balancing customersâ€™ habits, behaviors, frustrations, needs, and wants.

            <p class="text-justify"> Forming the idea is done trough multiple question and task-based workshops with the
              client and the targeted users. By utilizing techniques like <b>Journey Maps</b> we tend to capture a user idea
              through a high-level description of the desired task or process. By documenting the triggers,
              motivation and user-experience we deep dive into the details of the idea, while user emotions help us
              to identify pain-points and opportunities.

            <p class="text-justify">Next step is to visualize and create a draft of the solution, a mock-up used as a basis for further
              higher precision designs. This draft versions are great for exploring an idea because of a low cost investment,
              and they allow to, relatively easy, filter out the bad approaches. A great way of visualizing and structuring is by
              creating <b>Wireframes</b> - a sketch or blueprint that is useful for showing and communicating the structure of
              the software solution.

              test to solution through a series of feedback-based user sessions. The main objective is to gather unbiased
              data from users in a specifically targeted market segment and catch any information architecture and usability
              issues. After the verification, product designs serve as the blueprint and provide detailed guidance to the
              product implementation effort.
